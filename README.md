# AI Hedge Fund

[English](README.md) | [Bahasa Indonesia](docs/README_ID.md)

This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered hedge fund.  The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions.  This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

This system employs several agents working together:

1. Ben Graham Agent - The godfather of value investing, only buys hidden gems with a margin of safety
2. Bill Ackman Agent - An activist investors, takes bold positions and pushes for change
3. Cathie Wood Agent - The queen of growth investing, believes in the power of innovation and disruption
4. Charlie Munger Agent - Warren Buffett's partner, only buys wonderful businesses at fair prices
5. Stanley Druckenmiller Agent - Macro trading legend who hunts for asymmetric opportunities with explosive growth potential
6. Warren Buffett Agent - The oracle of Omaha, seeks wonderful companies at a fair price
7. Valuation Agent - Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and generates trading signals
8. Sentiment Agent - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals
9. Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals
10. Technicals Agent - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
11. Risk Manager - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits
12. Portfolio Manager - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders

## Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

1. Install Python 3.9 or higher from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Install Poetry:

For Windows (PowerShell), run as administrator:
```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```

Add Poetry to PATH and verify installation:
```powershell
# Add to PATH
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";$env:APPDATA\Python\Scripts", "User")

# Refresh environment variables in current terminal
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")

# Verify installation
poetry --version
```

3. Install dependencies:
```powershell
# Configure poetry to create virtual environment in project directory
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Generate lock file if needed
poetry lock
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```powershell
# Create .env file for your API keys
copy .env.example .env
```

5. Set your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
# Get your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For running LLMs hosted by groq (deepseek, llama3, etc.)
# Get your Groq API key from https://groq.com/
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key

# For running LLMs through OpenRouter (claude-3, mistral, etc.)
# Get your OpenRouter API key from https://openrouter.ai/
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
# Get your Financial Datasets API key from https://financialdatasets.ai/
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

**Important**: You must set at least one of these API keys for the hedge fund to work:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- `GROQ_API_KEY` - For Groq-hosted models (LLaMA, DeepSeek)  
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - For OpenRouter models (Claude-3, Mistral)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For Anthropic models (Claude)

If you want to use models from all providers, you will need to set all API keys.

Financial data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free and does not require an API key.

For any other ticker, you will need to set the `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` in the .env file.

Note: After installing Poetry, you may need to:
1. Close and reopen your terminal
2. Or restart Visual Studio Code
3. Or restart your computer

You can verify the installation by running:
```powershell
%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts\poetry --version
```

## Usage

### Running the Hedge Fund
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

**Example Output:**
<img width="992" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 5 50 17 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8ca04bf-9989-4a7d-a8b4-34e04666663b" />

You can also specify a `--show-reasoning` flag to print the reasoning of each agent to the console.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --show-reasoning
```
You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions for a specific time period.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01 
```

### Running the Backtester

```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

**Example Output:**

You can optionally specify the start and end dates to backtest over a specific time period.

```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01
```
